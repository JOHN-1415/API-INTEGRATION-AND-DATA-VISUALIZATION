DESCRIPTION:

Project Overview
This project is a dynamic tool that fetches and visualizes real-time weather data for multiple cities using the OpenWeatherMap API. It provides insights into temperature, humidity, and wind speed across different locations. The program structures the retrieved data into a tabular format, making it easier to analyze trends and relationships between meteorological parameters.

To enhance data interpretation, various visualization techniques such as bar plots, scatter plots, and correlation heatmaps are used. These visualizations allow users to compare weather conditions across different cities, observe patterns, and better understand climate variations.

Features
Live Weather Data Retrieval – Fetches real-time temperature, humidity, and wind speed for multiple cities.
Data Structuring – Organizes the API response into a structured format for better readability.
Error Handling – Displays meaningful messages if incorrect city names are entered or if an API error occurs.
Multiple Data Visualizations:
Bar Plot – Compares temperature variations among different cities.
Scatter Plot – Shows the relationship between temperature and humidity.
Correlation Heatmap – Highlights trends and correlations between weather parameters.
User Input Driven – Allows users to specify city names and retrieve customized weather data.
Project Workflow
1. User Input for API Call
The user provides a list of cities for which weather data needs to be retrieved. Additionally, an API key is required to authenticate the request. The input system ensures flexibility by allowing multiple city names to be entered at once.

2. Fetching Weather Data from OpenWeatherMap API
The program sends requests to the OpenWeatherMap API, retrieving the latest weather details for the specified cities. Key parameters such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed are extracted and structured for analysis. If any errors occur, such as an incorrect city name, the program notifies the user accordingly.

3. Displaying Data in Tabular Format
Once the data is retrieved, it is displayed in a tabular format, providing users with a clear and concise view of the weather conditions. This structured format helps in comparing different cities based on key weather attributes.

4. Data Visualization
To make the information more insightful, the project offers multiple visualization methods:

A. Bar Plot – Temperature Comparison Across Cities
A bar plot is used to compare the temperatures of different cities, providing a clear visual representation of temperature variations.

B. Scatter Plot – Temperature vs. Humidity Relationship
A scatter plot illustrates how temperature and humidity are related, allowing users to observe potential trends between these two parameters.

C. Correlation Heatmap – Identifying Weather Trends
A correlation heatmap provides a visual representation of how different weather attributes (temperature, humidity, and wind speed) relate to each other. It helps in identifying patterns and dependencies between different factors.

Use Cases
Weather Trend Analysis – Helps users analyze temperature and humidity variations across multiple cities.
Climate Studies – Useful for researchers studying weather patterns and correlations.
API Data Visualization – Serves as an example of how to fetch and visualize API data effectively.
Learning and Educational Purposes – A great project for students and developers learning about API integration and data visualization.
